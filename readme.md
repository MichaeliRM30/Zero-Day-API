Problem Statement

Zero Day Software Vulnerabilities (often known as Zero-Days,) are major IT security threats that 
require immediate attention.  Software vendors send alerts about such vulnerabilities in their products, 
but with the large number of software products a typical large business uses, such warnings are often 
overlooked in the volume of incoming email.  What is needed to aggregate the alerts into a single service, 
which security teams could access at any time.
