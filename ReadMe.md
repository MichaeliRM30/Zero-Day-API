### *Background:*

Zero Day Software Vulnerabilities (often known as Zero-Days,) are major IT security threats that 
require immediate attention. These are typically vulnerabilities in a system or device that have been disclosed but have not yet been patched. Vulnerable systems are exposed
until a patch is issued. Software vendors send alerts about such vulnerabilities in their products, but with the large number of software products a typical large business uses,
such warnings are often overlooked in the volume of incoming communications that they recieve. What is needed is a way to condense all of these the alerts into a single service, 
or system that varous business security teams could access at any time. 


### *Problem Statement:*

Zero Day Software Vulnerabilities (Zero-Days,) are major IT security threats that require immediate attention. Our service will attempt to aggregate these alerts into a single service which security teams could access at any time for the latest data on these threats.
