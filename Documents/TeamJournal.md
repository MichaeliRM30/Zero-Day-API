### JOURNAL ENTRY #1 - October 27, 2021
*Attendees: Ryan, Julie, Tosan, Subu.*

This journal entry covers the team meeting activities from 10/27/2021. 

1. Went through the team agenda provided by Paula in Slack.

2. The main goal was to discuss and work on how to complete the feedback points left by the instructor. 
	We discussed how we were going to complete the following deliverables:
	- The Team Repository
	- Created a Team Charter and Ground Rules
	- Worked on completing the Team Resume
	- Assigned the drafting of the Problem Statement and Solution Description 
	- The collection of all data needed to add to the Team Project list in the student repository

3. At first, the team brainstormed some ideas on what the service we would create would be and what it would do. 
	- Julie had the idea of doing something in the realm of cyber security and brought up the idea of scanning for Zero-Days.
	- As some of us were new to this, she needed to explain it to us.
	- Zero-Days: A zero-day is a newly-detected vulnerability where no patch exists.  Aggregating information about these hazards, (from several security sites) is the base concept. 
	Information includes the vulnerable application, what could potentially happen (if known) and any workaround recommended by the software company.

4. The team discussed what we would need to properly create a service that can process this information, and where we would go to gather it. 
	- Julie indicated she would research some sites and repositories for this data for us to use. 

5. Once the idea was decided upon, the initial deliverables were discussed and divided amongst the team.
	- Ryan (Team Repository) - Ryan would create this for the team by 11/2.
	- Tosan (Team Charter and Ground Rules) - Tosan would summarize and record the rules created at this initial meeting by 11/2.
	- All team members (Team Resume) - All team members would submit answers to the resume questions, and Tosan would create the document from them.
	- Julie (Problem Statement) - Julie would create the problem statement for this project by 11/1. 

6. We then went to work on deciding a team name. Using a listing Ryan found on a site, we found several root words that were interesting, but the word ‘Aegis’ stuck out to Tosan. 
	- He suggested we use that as a root word for the name as it meant protection in Greek mythology, and protection is another form of security. 
	- Ryan suggested we use the term ‘Blue’ somehow as this is directly involved in cyber security when referring to Red vs. Blue or Red Team, Blue Team
	- When these were combined - the team name AegisBlue was generated and agreed upon. 

7. We then decided on Team Communications and how to maintain all of this.
	- We picked Tuesday 6:00 - 7:00 as the meeting time.
	- The Blackboard Collaborate Room C (from the rooms Paula created) was selected as the venue.

8. We closed the meeting by discussing a preliminary project presentation plan to see how this would all play out.
	The plan (for now is):
	- A PowerPoint to discuss who we are as a team and what we are doing.
	- A code Review to show the code that the project utilizes.
	- A live demo to show the code and the service in action.
	- A review of the documentation created to accompany the service.
	
9. *Meeting Ends*
